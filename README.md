***
* Install Anaconda

    Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial use and redistribution). It includes over 195 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, data analysis.
Download from [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads).

* Download this repository
* (Optional) Install Visual Studio 2015 with Python Tools

    You may see there are solution files inside the repository. You may want to use Visual Studio 2015 to open it and do some modifications.

* Done. Follow the **How do I use it?** section below to do your experiments.

1. Drebin

    For Drebin, please make the repository folder as the current working directory. The arguments of Drebin are: 

    **VocabularyDirectory, MalwareDirectory, GoodwareDirectory, TestBad, TestGood, ProcessNumber, Option**

    You have to specify at least **VocabularyDirectory, MalwareDirectory, GoodwareDirectory** before conducting any experiments.

    a. Meaning of the parameters:

    * VocabularyDirectory: Absolute path of directory you want to store the Vocabulary in. It is like a temporary directory. You can observe the directories generated by Drebin when conducting the experiments.
    * MalwareDirectory: The location of the malware training set folder. It can be an absolute path of folder that contains all malware Apks or a folder that contains folders of malware Apks(used for malware family analysis and malware online analysis). More details will be shown in the functionality section.
    * GoodwareDirectory: The location of the benign-ware training set folder. It is an absolute path of folder that contains all benign-ware Apks.
    * TestBad: The location of the malware training set folder. It is an absolute path of folder that contains all malware Apks.
    * TestGood: The location of the benign-ware training set folder. It is an absolute path of folder that contains all benign-ware Apks.
    * ProcessNumber: The number of processes that you want to parallelly run. It depends on how many cores your CPU have. E.g. If you have Intel 4 cores Core i7 CPU, then you’d better set this parameter to be 3. (One core for you to do some other tasks.)
    * Option: Set this parameter to do automatically execution of Drebin. If you want to do Drebin experiments manually, i.e. select what functionality you want to use, you should leave this parameter as empty.

    b. Functionalities:

    Once you run Drebin without setting the Option parameter, you shall see some prompts to let you input the Option. Each option corresponds to one functionality.

    1. Random split classification:

        **Option 1** allows you to do a random split classification for the given malware dataset and benign-ware dataset. The MalwareDirectory and GoodwareDirectory parameters should be the directories containing malware Apks and benign-ware Apks. The program will ask you to generate the missing data files for all Apks. (If you run the code for the first time, you need to generate the data files by input “Y”, otherwise you can input “N”.) After the data files are generated, the program will do the random split classification automatically.

    2. Hold-out classification:

        **Option 2** allows you to specify the testing set. You can do a hold-out classification for the given trainning set and test set. Beside seting the trainning set arguments as Option 1, you need to specify the testing set parameters in the command line arguments, i.e. TestBad and TestGood. The program will ask you to generate the missing data files for all Apks. (If you run the code for the first time, you need to generate the data files by input “Y”, otherwise you can input “N”.) After the data files are generated, the program will do the hold-out classification automatically.

    3. Malware family analysis:

        **Option 3 and 4** relates to malware family analysis. 

        Option 3 is used to get all features of malware families. The MalwareDirectory parameter here should be the parent folder of all the specific malware family folders.(GoodwareDirectory parameter is still the absolute path of folder that contains all benign-ware Apks.) You don’t need to set TestBad and TestGood parameters, i.e. you have to set these two parameters to be “” and “” in order to set the ProcessNumber parameter. The program will ask you to generate the missing data files for all Apks. (If you run the code for the first time, you need to generate the data files by input “Y”, otherwise you can input “N”.) And the program will ask you what are the penalty parameter and how many features you want to select. 

        The output file is under current working directory, which is named as “FeatureNamesAndImportance.txt”.

        Option 4 allows you to do random split classification for these malware families. This function is like a batch processing of Option 1. So you can also use this function to do a batch classification on a dataset with similar folder structure.

        The output file is under current working directory, which is named as “FeatureFamiliesAndResults.txt”.

        The program will automatically ignore the folders that it failed to do the classification.

    4. Online analysis:
        
        **Option 6, 7 and 8** relates to online analysis. 

        Option 6 will rename Apks and rearrange the test sets structure according to the class.dex file generation date. The original dataset structure will be modified.

        **Before**

        ![  ](https://bitbucket.org/repo/jrk9xo/images/2646654263-Capture.PNG)

        **After**

        In each folder there will be some apks with the name as Date_ApkName, where the date format is described in [this document](https://docs.python.org/2/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo.date_time):

        ![Capture.PNG](https://bitbucket.org/repo/jrk9xo/images/156275549-Capture.PNG)

        Option 7 is used to conduct online analysis. The data set should be firstly prepared using Option 6.

        Program will ask you to input training window size, testing window size, output file name and online analysis option. 

        There are two online analysis options. One is once and another is daily. Once means the program will only train once using the training set starting from initial day to initial day plus how many days specified by training window size. Daily means the program will train continuously and test using the subsequent days specified by testing window size.

        Option 8 lets you specify which Apks you want to do the analysis. You can have the flexibility to selectively choose some Apks using the names defined in "DrebinSelectedNames.txt"(Each line is an Apk name), which is inside the Drebin.py folder. Program will only analyze these Apks and ignore others. 

        Note that this option will modify the name of all Apks inside the dataset folder during execution. It will restore the name back after execution.

        *Note that there is no Option 5. Option 5 was designed to do a multi-class analysis but not done.*
